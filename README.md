# Go-loveCoffee
Like the original loveCoffee written in python, found here: https://github.com/liquidlegs/loveCoffee. This script is slightly different but is pretty much the same thing rewritten in Golang.

If you want to build this yourself, first of all download Go here https://golang.org/
then open terminal and go to go/src directory and type 'go build loveCoffee.go'
If you want the window to be hidden then type 'go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui loveCoffee.go'
